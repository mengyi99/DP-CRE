>Continuous Relation Extraction (CRE) aims to incrementally learn relation knowledge from a non-stationary stream of data. One significant challenge in this domain is catastrophic forgetting, where the introduction of new relational tasks can overshadow previously learned information. Unlike traditional replay-based training paradigms that uniformly prioritize all data, we decouple the process of prior information preservation and new knowledge acquisition. In this paper, we introduce the Decouple Processed CRE (DP-CRE) framework. This approach examines alterations in the embedding space as new relation classes emerge, distinctly managing the preservation and acquisition of knowledge. Extensive experiments show that DP-CRE significantly outperforms other CRE
baselines across two datasets.

## Dataset

We use `FewRel` and `TACRED` datasets in our experiments.
- FewRel: `data/data_with_marker.json`
- TACRED: `data/data_with_marker_tacred.json`

The splited datasets and task orders is conducted in `sample.py`.

## Usage

To reproduce the results of main experiment:
```
python main.py --task_name FewRel
python main.py --task_name TACRED
```
